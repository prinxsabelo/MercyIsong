          Mercy Isong Outreach Foundation is a nationwide movement built 
          to empower widows of all ages in their time of need from churches and communities.
        </p>
        <p>We are one body in Christ with the responsibility to provide 
              spiritual, charitable and financial support to widows in need.

              More than enough churches have not a way to communicate effectively with their widows,
              our primary objective is to help the church recapture its God given call
              to support widows in order for them to enjoy emotional wellbeing
              which translates to their better quality of life. 
          </p>
